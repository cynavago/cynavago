<h2> Hi there! üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª‚ú® </h2>
  
I'm Cynthia Navarro, a web developer and graphic designer from San Diego, CA.

After working as a graphic designer for 7 years, I decided to enroll in LEARN Academy, a full-stack web development bootcamp. Throughout my career, I've focused on creating visual experiences for users and consumers in the tech and music industry. The full-stack web development bootcamp has taught me to become a better designer by being able to think through my ideas from a technical perspective. I believe that the combination of design and development allows you to solve a problem visually but with a deeper understanding of the languages and frameworks that support that design. In the future, I hope to be able to contribute to user-friendly and intuitive experiences that facilitate the relationship between people and technology.
