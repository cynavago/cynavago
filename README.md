<h2> Hi there! 👩🏽‍💻✨ </h2>
  
I'm Cynthia Navarro, a web developer and graphic designer from San Diego, CA. Since starting my design career, I became interested in makerspaces and communities where people with common interests, such as machining, technology, and digital art, came together to collaborate. This journey led me to think about creating products in both physical and digital spaces.

After working as a graphic designer for 7 years, I decided to enroll in LEARN Academy, a full-stack web development bootcamp. Throughout my career, I've focused on creating visual experiences for users and consumers in the tech and music industry. The full-stack web development bootcamp has taught me to become a better designer by being able to think through my ideas from a technical perspective. I believe that the combination of design and development allows you to solve a problem visually but with a deeper understanding of the languages and frameworks that support that design. In the future, I hope to be able to contribute to user-friendly and intuitive experiences that facilitate the relationship between people and technology.
